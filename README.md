Currently this project has been tested on Ubuntu 13.10.

It may work on other debian based distributions as is. It will also work on Mac OS X and RPM based linux distributions with minor modifications.

Future goals include porting the logic into python to be more universal and finding a better method of interacting with bluetooth as bluez is notoriously fickle (In my testing the script has been working flawlessly though).
