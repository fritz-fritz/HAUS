#  OVERVIEW: This script is designed to intelligently control lighting
#  in a home. It requires a Belkin WeMo switch, a server continuously on,
#  and a bluetooth reciever.
#
#  INSTALL: Instructions will go here until a script can be made for that...
#
#  Take care to protect this script if you modify it with your login credentials.
#  You will also need to add the btPing.sh script to your sudoer file to enable it
#  to be run without entering your sudo password.
